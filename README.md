<h1 style="text-align: center;">Cashback Calculator</h1>

## What is Cashback Calculator?
Cashback Calculator is a web application designed to help its users know what credit card they should use to get the most cashback for a purchase they are planning to make.

## Why?
I have always tried to figure out how to get the best rewards when using my credit cards. I have done this by using my notes app on my phone, making spreadsheets, or even just trying to memorize what percentage cashback I get at which locations for each card I have. I decided it would be much easier to have an app that does this for me. I also saw this as an opportunity to practice and showcase my skills programming in Laravel PHP.

## How was it made?
I am using Laravel, Vanilla JS, Jquery, Sqlite, and twitter Bootstrap

## Direction of the Project:
For now I am making a MVP just to showcase my skills and be able to store a few cards and track their rewards. Eventually I would like to have an authentication system in place so users can save their cards and come back it whenever they like. I also would like to pull info about different cards from an API so users can select their card from a list of popular cards and also get recommendations for cards that could help them get more cashback in specific categories.
